#### It’s almost like she was made for this job …

Yumi Hara is a newly hired programmer at Ming Systems Inc. whose job is to train robots in real-world scenarios. The latest prototypes are a real nuisance—like hyperactive children—but Yumi handles it with ease … almost like a mother? Her coworker Yang is growing suspicious … something seems OFF about that girl … but what? Her girlfriend doesn’t seem to care!
