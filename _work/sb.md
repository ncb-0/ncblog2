SB [(sbintl.cc)](http://sbintl.cc) is my independent type foundry and type design practice. I started it in 2018 with my friend [Caleb Woodward](http://twitter.com/neuume) as a shared label to release design work under—each of us branding our designs with the SB logo and name. With the release of my typeface Spec in January 2020, SB’s focus has shifted towards type design with myself behind the wheel.

New typefaces, along with a refreshed SB website, will be released soon. You can purchase Spec or commission a custom typeface via email—[sb@sbintl.cc](mailto:sb@sbintl.cc)
