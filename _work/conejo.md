The [Conejo Committee](http://casaconejo.neocities.org) inhabits and maintains Conejo Island, a virtual commune in Second Life founded by my close friend [Sofa.](http://yogurt200.neocities.org)

Conejo is divided into several smaller parcels of land owned by different residents, each with their own unique flavour and decorations. I live on my parcel [Isla Piraba](/work/piraba#isla-piraba) where I also host music events.

Some other places in Conejo include a community park, a Japanese-style bar, an onsen, and a large shared house where the committee members meet.

### Golden Egg Ball ðŸ¥šðŸŽµ

On 2 May 2020, Sofa and I hosted the Conejo Island Golden Egg Ball, a dance party in a webcore-looking floating venue featuring my 2-hour DJ set retroactively titled "conejoBeat zero."
