I've decided to rebuild my online presenceâ€”Twitter stresses me the fuck out. Constant political drama, 16-year-olds calling my friends nazis over stupid shit, etc. Plus, the character limits and overall formatting of platforms like Twitter don't really allow for long-form writing. I'm realizing I have a lot to say and I don't write nearly as much as I should.

I think it'll be fun to have something to look back on in 20 years and laugh at â€¦ or maybe learn a little from. ðŸ˜³

As time goes on, I'd like for this site to become my true home on the internet. I'm too young to have experienced it, but I miss the days of eccentric personal homepages and self-hosted blogs. Web design technologies have come so far since thenâ€”it makes me a little sad that social media platforms offering next to no customization have become the norm! My websites are always fun for me to come back to and tweak the style of.

With ncb0.work and my webring [piraba.net,](http://piraba.net) my aim is to bring that creativity back a little. Expect to see me on Twitter less, and posting more here and on Discord.

<!-- ### What do you do? ðŸ¤¨

Some know me for illustration, some know me for [type design](http://sbintl.cc) or graphic design â€¦ some know me for drawing [furry porn?](http://twitter.com/awabug) *(R-18)* [I do a little music, too.](http://soundcloud.com/ncb0) If I was any more full of myself than I am already I would call myself a polymath. But I hate that word and I'd rather just say I'm "skilled in many areas" than claim to be some kind of modern Da Vinci.

I've been filling sketchbooks and drawing (but never finishing) comics since I was seven or eight. I see myself as an artist first, and everything else second. -->
