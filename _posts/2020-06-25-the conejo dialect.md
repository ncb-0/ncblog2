The members of the Conejo Committee have developed a strange set of vocal tics and slang that have come to be referred to as "conejospeak." <!-- more --> It seems to borrow randomly from Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, and other dialects of English. This is a half-serious attempt to document the slang my friends and I use.

### Pronunciation

- The initial "th" consonant found in words such as "the, this, that (etc.)" is usually substituted for a "d" consonant: ex. "What *da* fuck?"
- Certain vowels may be transformed or omitted: ex. "the &rarr; *da*"; "lol &rarr; l*aw*l"; "food &rarr; f*ew*d," etc.
- Further, an "e" may be suffixed to these already mutated words: ex. "lawl &rarr; lawl*e*."
- As the dialect has evolved, it has become increasingly common for speakers to omit the finial consonants from such transformed words: ex. "goodnight &rarr; goodn*ai*"; "good &rarr; g*ew*."
- These vowely words are often drawn out and/or repeated: ex. "Good nai nai lawwwe lawwwe"

### Misc. grammar

- The habitual "be" is commonly used: ex. "She do *be* crazy doooooeeeeeeee!"
- Aux. verbs are often omitted: ex. "*Dis a* whole other level."
- Less commonly, articles and prepositions are omitted: ex. "He *went store*."
- Conjugation and plurality agreements are often ignored: ex. "*We was* wolves!"; "I saw *they photo*."
