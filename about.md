I’m Mel Marshall (she/her), a 19-year-old trans artist, graphic designer, and type designer in Toronto. I’ve been drawing comics since age 8, painting since age 11, designing graphics since age 13, and designing fonts since age 17.

With art, I aim for improvised looseness and childlike naivety, exploiting my media of choice, and abusing perspective and anatomy rules as I see fit.

With design, I aim for an almost alienating feeling of sterility, technicality, and precision—paying homage to design of the ’60s, ’90s, and 2000s.

In my free time I like to code websites, make music, and hang out + organize events with friends in Second Life.
