You found the secret about page … congrats?

###### Melscellanies
- My name is actually short for Melona (the Korean melon ice cream bar) and my initials are M.N.M.
- My PSN is “nezubo_” but I literally only play FFXIV on it … name is Yaya Mishka and server is Goblin.
- I came up with the name “ncb0” during a psychotic episode but it has stuck ever since. It started as “neko robotto,” which I shortened to “necobo,” which finally became “ncb0.” It was supposed to be pronounced “necobo” until a friend sent some shit like “WHAT UP ENCEEBIO” on Discord and I’ve said it like that in my head ever since. Both are valid pronunciations in addition to “necíbo.”

- I speak a little Japanese, a little Mandarin, and a VERY little amount of Russian. I gave up on Japanese because kanji make my head explode. Chinese is way easier than most people think—its writing system is SIMPLE albeit time-consuming to learn, and I would argue that its grammar is easier than English. As for Russian … I love you so much but I am having difficulties. Cyrillic may be my favourite script to design and I include it in all my retail typefaces.
- I am transgender and lesbian but Ser Aymeric from FFXIV makes me question that sometimes.
- I write all my websites by hand. I’m sure site builders are easier but I am an asshole and I have more fun this way. This site was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using VS Code. Also all of my sites use 100% custom type designed by me, because I can.
- I am pretty good at drawing with a mouse. I bought an iPad in May 2020 and I basically never use it because its screen is too slippery and it gives me TOO MUCH precision. I draw on my dirt-cheap Wacom Intuos using CSP Pro with a ton of custom keyboard shortcuts and a very basic set of custom brushes. As retarded as this sounds the scratchy Wacom gives me LESS control which I need to achieve my characteristic line style … blah blah
