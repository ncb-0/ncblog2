  <h2>24 32</h2>
  <div class="post-full-content">
    <p>24 32 is a short comic zine and my first printed book. In 2018, I sold a limited run of it at <a href="http://www.beguilingbooksandart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external2">The Beguiling.</a> I kinda just went crazy with it and tried to have fun making something short, but I don’t know if it holds up well.</p>

<p>Set in 2432 AD, 24 32 follows a twenty-something cat and her talking Roomba as they get bored and go on the Dark Web. This leads to limb amputation, nudity, swearing, and a really annoying anime catgirl.</p>

<p>For 24 32’s art, I decided to break away from my then-usual style of illustration and aim for shitty MS Paint-ish crudeness. The book’s layout and typography are a nightmare—no defined backgrounds, dialogue and interactions that regularly break the expected reading flow, and a mess of awful and expensive typeface choices.</p>

<p>A sequel named 48 64 was planned but never released.</p>
