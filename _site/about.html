<p>You found the secret about page … congrats?</p>

<ul>
  <li>My name is actually short for Melona (the Korean melon ice cream bar) and my initials are M.N.M.</li>
  <li>My PSN is “nezubo_” but I literally only play FFXIV on it … name is Yaya Mishka and server is Goblin.</li>
  <li>I came up with the name “ncb0” during a psychotic episode but it has stuck ever since. It started as “neko robotto,” which I shortened to “necobo,” which finally became “ncb0.” It was supposed to be pronounced “necobo” until a friend sent some shit like “WHAT UP ENCEEBIO” on Discord and I’ve said it like that in my head ever since. Both are valid pronunciations in addition to “necíbo.”</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/matushkasobak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external2">My partner is very cool.</a></li>
  <li>I speak a little Japanese, a little Mandarin, and a VERY little amount of Russian. I gave up on Japanese because kanji make my head explode. Chinese is way easier than most people think—its writing system is SIMPLE albeit time-consuming to learn, and I would argue that its grammar is easier than English. As for Russian … I love you so much but I am having difficulties. Cyrillic may be my favourite script to design and I include it in all my retail typefaces.</li>
  <li>I am transgender and lesbian but Ser Aymeric from FFXIV makes me question that sometimes.</li>
  <li>I write all my websites by hand. I’m sure site builders are easier but I am an asshole and I have more fun this way. This site was built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external2">Jekyll</a> using VS Code. Also all of my sites use 100% custom type designed by me, because I can.</li>
  <li>I am pretty good at drawing with a mouse. I bought an iPad in May 2020 and I basically never use it because its screen is too slippery and it gives me TOO MUCH precision. I draw on my dirt-cheap Wacom Intuos using CSP Pro with a ton of custom keyboard shortcuts and a very basic set of custom brushes. As retarded as this sounds the scratchy Wacom gives me LESS control which I need to achieve my characteristic line style … blah blah</li>
